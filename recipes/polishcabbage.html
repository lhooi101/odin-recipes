    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My mother often served a delicious Polish dish made with cabbage. We always topped ours with a dollop of sour cream and sometimes served this over mashed potatoes.</p>
    <p>You can make this just using the cabbage, but I add kielbasa or smoked turkey for additional flavour. Delicious.</p>
    <br>
